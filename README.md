# Deep Learning IT Cortex Simulation

This project explores the use of deep learning to simulate the hierarchical visual processing of the primate brain, specifically targeting the face-selective responses of the inferior temporal (IT) cortex. In this project, CNNs of increasing complexity were implemented to replicate biologically observed behavior in the IT cortex under various visual conditions, particularly focusing on the effects of removing important facial features.
